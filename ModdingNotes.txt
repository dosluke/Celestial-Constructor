Creating this to store some info to come back to for myself, and other aspiring mod creators in the future.

Only 2 sections of the folder structure matter. Scripts need to be in <MODROOT>\Data\Scripts\SomeFolder or deeper within somefolder. And SBCs need to be in <MODROOT>\Data or deeper within the data folder.
Scripts must stay in the same folder because of the way the game assembles them.
SBCs point to all the other related files relative to the root of the mod, or if they are not found, relative to the game folder.

Its possible/advisable to use assets directly from the game without copying to keep mod size and memory down, except for sounds (and possibly others) which have to be copied apparently.
